# Three-State-Life

This is a repository for very large pattern files for the Generations cellular automata rule 23/3/3.  
Contained within are several iterations of the tagalong puffer breeder.  
TSLBreederImproved.mc is the second iteration, and was the first breeder designed after the creation of "Hush Now Gregory" using rakes based on output from it.  
Information of the various breeders is listed below.
